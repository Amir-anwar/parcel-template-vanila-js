// The tools folder is where your global Sass mixins and functions live. Maybe
// you want to manipulate colors with blend modes or set the aspect ratio for a
// video container? Or clear your float, for example. I am not
// a heavy user of mixins myself, but I know many
// people who love them, so this is where to put them.
